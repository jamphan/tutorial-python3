# Lesson 01: Basics

## Part A: Opening your Terminal:

### Windows

1. Press `win`+`R`
2. Type in "Powershell" and press Enter

You should see a blue window with something that looks like this:

```
Windows PowerShell
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Try the new cross-platform PowerShell https://aka.ms/pscore6

PS C:\Users\jamphan>
```

- The first four lines are just a welcome message, and it may vary. You can ignore all of that.
- The line that has `PS C:\Users\jamphan>` is where you will type in your commands.
- The `PS C:\Users\jamphan>` is called the "prompt". When you see this, powershell is "prompt"-ing you to type in a command.
    - The `PS` means "Powershell"
    - The path `C:\Users\jamphan` is the current folder you are working from. (`jamphan` is my username, so you should see your username instead)
    - The `>` is the prompt to signal where the text you enter will start.

### Mac

1. Open up Spotlight (`cmd`+`Space`)
2. Type in "Terminal" and press Enter

You should see a black or white window with something that looks like this:

```
jamphan-mac:~ jamphan$
```

- The text `jamphan-mac:~ jamphan$` is called "prompt". When you see this, powershell is "prompt"-ing you to type in a command.
    - The text before the `:` is your computers name (you probably entered this in way back when you first booted your computer). My computer is called `jamphan-mac`
    - The `~` is short-hand for your Home folder, and indicates you are currently working from your Home folder
    - `jamphan` is my username, you should see your own.
    - `$` is the prompt to signal where the text you enter will start.

## Part A: Terminal Basics

**For simplicity, I'm just going to use `$` as shorthand for the prompt, do not enter this character in!**
